# SAP UI5 Employee Management Application

## Overview
This is a comprehensive SAP UI5 application that demonstrates modern enterprise application development patterns. The application provides a complete employee management system with list and detail views, featuring navigation, data binding, filtering, and CRUD operations.

## Architecture

### Key Components

**Component.js** - Main application entry point that handles initialization, routing setup, and global model management. This follows the Component-based architecture pattern that SAP UI5 promotes for scalable applications.

**Controllers** - Business logic separated into focused, single-responsibility controllers:
- `EmployeeList.js` - Manages the employee directory with search, filtering, and navigation
- `EmployeeDetail.js` - Handles individual employee profiles with edit/delete capabilities

**Views** - XML-based declarative UI definitions that provide clean separation between presentation and logic:
- `EmployeeList.view.xml` - Responsive table layout with search capabilities
- `EmployeeDetail.view.xml` - Detailed profile view with contact information

**Routing** - Configured through manifest.json to enable deep-linking and proper navigation flow between list and detail views.
